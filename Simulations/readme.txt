#README FOR SIMULATIONS

All generic simulations can be run from within the GeneralSimulations folder. 

NOTE: the simulation code is not as documented as the main tool due to time constraints. Also not every script is still used, but remains included here for backup purposes and being able to reconstruct old results if necessary.


# How the code is setup and how to run the simulations

One simulation can be started from the code runSimulation.py. This script will run simulation_generic.py. As we ran our code on a HPC system, there are also .sh files that allow running the code in parallel.
The sh scripts, such as runSimulation.sh, can be used for specific scenarios of e.g. running 100 simulations with 1 mu. 

In simulationSettings.py in the GeneralSimulations folder, settings can be specified for the simulations. So to run a simulation with e.g. shuffling all LAF and SNVs, this can be specified within this settings script. 


TGCC-based simulations were generated by running runSimulation.py with runSimulation.sh from the top Simulations folder.
